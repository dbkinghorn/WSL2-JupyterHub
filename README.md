# WSL2-JupyterHub
JupyterHub install scripts for WSL2 (with init.d startup)

## Not working yet! Some kind of problem with paths
jhub server starts, login is OK but single-user spawner is not found.
Giving full path to single-user-server in config file does work and jupyterlab starts 
But, notebooks don't load default extensions (Cell menu item is  missing) and shift-return doesn't give new cell consistantly...
Ugggg!
